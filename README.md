An AI-powered multi-agent system that automates the design of Customer 360¬∞ data products for the retail banking sector. This project was developed as a submission for an **Accenture GenAI Hackathon**.

## üöÄ Overview

In the banking industry, creating a new data product‚Äîlike a system to identify customers for a new loan offer‚Äîis a slow, manual process. Data teams spend weeks understanding business needs, designing data schemas, and mapping data sources.

**BankGen360** solves this by using a crew of specialized AI agents. You provide a simple business problem, and the autonomous agents work together like an assembly line to produce a complete technical design document in minutes, not weeks.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Automated Requirement Analysis:** An AI agent interprets the business problem and extracts the core objectives.
-   **Dynamic Schema Generation:** A Data Architect agent designs a robust JSON schema for the final data product.
-   **Intelligent Source Mapping:** A mapping specialist agent identifies the likely source systems (e.g., CRM, Core Banking) for each data field.
-   **Final Design Validation:** A QA agent reviews all artifacts for consistency and alignment with the initial goal.
-   **Interactive Web UI:** A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit to input use cases and view the generated results.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture

The project uses **CrewAI** to orchestrate a sequential workflow of AI agents. The output from one agent serves as the context for the next, ensuring a cohesive and logical process from start to finish.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Neha-git715/Accenture-GenAI-hacakthon.git](https://github.com/Neha-git715/Accenture-GenAI-hacakthon.git)
cd Accenture-GenAI-hacakthon
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create the environment
py -3.11 -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment (on Windows)
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Your API Key

The project uses the Google Gemini API, which has a generous free tier.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project folder.
2.  Get your free API key from **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikeys)**.
3.  Add your key to the `.env` file like this:

    ```
    # Inside your .env file
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIzaSyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Once the setup is complete, run the Streamlit application from your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your web browser will open to the application's UI. Enter a business use case and click the "Generate" button to start the AI crew!
